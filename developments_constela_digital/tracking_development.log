# New Bug appeared! When we want to create new cards for example, after new developments for adding the new punctuation, planka starts hiding or not displaying new cards and so on. We need to refresh the page in order to get the new cards created.

modifications implemented and index is working well. But there is no communcations with backend concerning punctuation.
